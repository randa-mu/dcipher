## Overview

**dcipher** is a modular protocol for [threshold cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshold_cryptosystem).  
It combines smart contracts and off-chain node operators to enable:

- Asynchronous Distributed Key Generation
- Threshold signing
- Identity-based encryption
- Chain abstraction

The repository is organized into:

- **Binaries (`bin/`)** – runnable agents, CLIs, and services.
- **Crates (`crates/`)** – Rust libraries used across the project.
- **Modules (`modules/`)** – **Git submodule dependencies** that pull in protocol-specific logic or external components.

### Modules (`modules/`)

These are **Git submodule dependencies**, not local crates.  
They typically include protocol-specific or external components maintained in separate repositories.  
Update them with:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust `1.89.0+`
- Node.js & npm
- `make`
- Foundry (if running the tests)

### Quickstart

Build everything, including solidity and tests:

```bash
make all
```

Build the repo (but not the tests):

```bash
cargo build
```

Build a specific binary (e.g. adkg-cli):

```bash
cargo build  --release -p adkg-cli
```

Clean artifacts:

```bash
make clean
make clean_node_modules
make clean_forge
```

---

## Bindings

If Solidity contracts change, regenerate Rust bindings:

```bash
./generate-bindings.sh
```

CI will fail if bindings are out of sync.

---

## Testing

- Rust crates:

```bash
cargo test --workspace
```

---

## Contributing

1. Fork & clone the repo
2. Create a feature branch
3. Run `cargo test` and `forge test` before pushing
4. Open a PR and ensure CI passes
