# onlyswaps-verifier

onlyswaps-verifier is an agent for verifying crosschain swap fulfilments by solvers in the dcipher network.
It listens across a configurable set of EVM blockchains, verifies solvers' reported fulfillments on destination chains
against swap requests on source chains, and cooperatively creates threshold signatures to unlock reimbursements and
earned fees for honest solvers.

## Start the Verifier

You can start the verifier by running:

```bash
onlyswaps-verifier start --config-file <CONFIG_FILE>
```

### CLI flags

- **--config-file <path-to-some-file>**
  A TOML or JSON file containing the rest of the configuration parameters required to connect to EVM blockchains and
  dcipher nodes. See [Configuration](#configuration).

### Configuration

An annotated, sample TOML configuration can be found below.  
You can generate a basic configuration using the [generate configuration](#generate-a-configuration-file) CLI command.

```toml
       # `agent` is used for general configuration and monitoring params
[agent]
healthcheck_listen_addr = "0.0.0.0"
healthcheck_port = 9999
log_level = "debug"     # debug, info, trace, error
log_json = true         # whether the logs should be structured as JSON or plaintext

# `networks` details all the configuration relating to connecting to blockchains. Each can be configured independently.
# Presently all networks must be supported, and skipping verifications for one route (chain -> chain) may cause errors.

## Generate a Configuration File

If you have a run a successful DKG using the [ADKG CLI](../adkg-cli/README.md), you can generate a corresponding config
for the onlyswaps-verifier using this command.  
Running configuration generation can be done as follows:

```bash
onlyswaps-verifier generate-config \
  --private /path/to/private/longterm.priv \       
  --group /path/to/group.toml \
  --public-share /path/to/public/keyshare.pub \
  --private-share /path/to/private/keyshare.priv \
  --multiaddr "/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/1234" \
  --member-id 1 \
  --contract-addr "0x4cB630aAEA9e152db83A846f4509d83053F21078" \
  --environment "mainnet"
```
