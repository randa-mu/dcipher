# adkg-cli
CLI tool used to prepare and execute asynchronous distributed key generation ceremonies using the ADKG described in [Practical Asynchronous Distributed Key Generation](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1591.pdf) by Das et al.

A ceremony is a three steps process: creation of a scheme specification, long-term key generation, and the execution of the ADKG.

## Networking
The ADKG relies on libp2p to exchange messages between the various nodes.
The current implementation requires all nodes to use tcp communication, the traffic is secured using [Noise](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/secure-comm/noise/), and multiplexed with [Yamux](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/multiplex/yamux/).
The node must allow incoming traffic on its libp2p tcp port, and tcp outbound traffic must be allowed to the rest of the nodes.

## Specifying a scheme
A scheme is used to describe an instance of the ADKG.
It contains various parameters, such as the curve, the number of parties and the malicious threshold.
Here is an example of a scheme specification used in the context of `dcipher`:  
```toml
app_name = "dcipher"
curve_id = "Bn254G1"
hash_id = "Keccak256"
adkg_version = "v0.1"
adkg_scheme_name = "DYX20-Bn254G1-Keccak256"
generator_g = "qB3/U8RDVn4aF2tUTlmeDQbV0PvHJ8IB0QL/k1Z+5WI="
generator_h = "gAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAE="
```

The `new-scheme` command can be used to obtain a scheme specification as follows:
```bash
adkg-cli new-scheme --app-name dcipher --scheme-out scheme.toml
```

By default, we use the `DYX20-Bn254G1-Keccak256` scheme.
This represents the aforementioned ADKG, using the bn254 curve on group G1.
In this configuration, the long-term public keys use a deterministic generator, `H`, obtained by hashing `ADKG_GENERATOR_G` with the DST `ADKG-%adkg_version%-%app_name%_BN254G1_XMD:KECCAK-256_SVDW_RO_GENERATORS_` using [rfc9380](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9380).
The public key after the ADKG, however, are output with respect to the standard generator of bn254, the point `(1, 2)`.

It is preferable that a single participant executes the `new-scheme` command, and sends the generated file to the rest of the participants.

## Generating long-term keys
With the scheme in hand, the next step consists of generating long-term keys that can be used to execute multiple instances of the ADKG.
We require the generation of two keypairs, an elliptic curve keypair `(sk, [sk] H)`, and an ed25519 libp2p keypair.

The former is used for the ADKG, while the latter to authenticate and encrypt network communications.

The `generate` command is used as follows and requires a `scheme.toml` file:
```bash
adkg-cli generate --scheme scheme.toml --priv-out adkg.priv --pub-out adkg.pub
```

The command writes the private key material to the `adkg.priv` file, and the public key material to `adkg.pub`.
Only the public key material must be forwarded to the rest of the participants.
As explained above, `adkg.pub` contains two different values:
```toml
adkg_pk = "6xBXHRXOlmPcfV2LqeEKEDAOGOoAH2pIYBnuG/h1w8s="
peer_id = "12D3KooWRLzVJSS2EYpc9Tm4BfV5HEdXc8DiKvQkFqWhEwXcJ8eP"
```

Once the public key material of each of the participant has been gather, a group configuration in the following format must be built and sent to the participants:
```toml
n = 7
t = 2
start_time = "2025-07-24T16:25:30Z"

[[nodes]]
id = 1
multiaddr = "/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/9991"
adkg_pk = "71zT8Vib8vHG3vX2cktMyFl5VngXFi8RLOkIw9a5ulI="
peer_id = "12D3KooWMSH17hbmMBSbEtCeyYBkFT7phd6PVaA2fdxakaTAuXMx"

[[nodes]]
id = 2
multiaddr = "/dns4/my.domain.com/tcp/1005"
adkg_pk = "354LSCLd/rCf8bX/vN+nWNfO2G2ZoLs/v054IAgiDFk="
peer_id = "12D3KooWMAADWEWNMFCNBadQfNFLeHHcYeZr9tNJBekY4opdCzDM"

[...]

[[nodes]]
id = 7
multiaddr = "/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/7777"
adkg_pk = "7dpgwvtWiLAw/TweCrzBeRuWahRbxqMwACwiiulYkfA="
peer_id = "12D3KooWGjQdQ6B3LazUw2EVbhakN3P5931e1UV76vJUNoV73Dd4"
```

This file contains the group configuration, which includes the number of parties (`n`), a threshold (`t`), and an agreed upon starting time, alongside a list of nodes.

Note that we use the malicious threshold here, i.e., the maximum number of parties that may be malicious.
The reconstruction threshold, i.e., the number of partials required to obtain a threshold signature, is obtained by adding one.

Each node is specified by its unique identifier, its public key material, and a libp2p multiaddress that can be used to communicate with the node.

Once this group file has been obtained and save, we can proceed to the final step.

## Executing the ADKG
Finally, to execute the ADKG, we must gather various piece of information:  
 - the scheme configuration file (`scheme.toml`)
 - the long-term private key file (`adkg.priv`)
 - the node's identifier (`1`) 
 - the group configuration (`group.toml`)
 - the libp2p listen address (`/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/7777`)

With those details, we can use the `run` command as follows:
```bash
adkg-cli run                                \
  --scheme ./scheme.toml                    \
  --group ./group.toml                      \
  --priv adkg.priv                          \
  --id 1                                    \
  --listen-address "/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/7777"  \
  --priv-out adkg.ceremony.priv             \
  --pub-out adkg.ceremony.pub 
```

Notice that we also include two output files used to store the private and public output of the ADKG.
